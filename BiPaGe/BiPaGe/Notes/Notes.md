# Anonimous names
In the current model we have removen the difference between anonimous structures/enumerations and 'normal' structures/enumerations. I'm not sure if by doing so we didn't introduce a language dependent construct in the model. 
There may be languages that support anonimous types (I don't know if there are, but I would be surprised if there are not) and besides that, there may be other ways to handle the difference. In python for instance, we may want to return anonimous structures as named tuples.
